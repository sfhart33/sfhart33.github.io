I am a 4th year PhD student at the University of Washington interested in evolutionary biology. I am a member of the [Metzger Lab](https://www.pnri.org/research/labs/metzger-lab/) at the Pacific Northwest Research Institute, where I study the evolutionary origins of a [contagious cancer in soft-shell clams](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4393529/). For my thesis I have characterized the genome evolution of the cancer, estimating the cancer to have [originated ~500 years ago and discovering that it has a massively restructured genome indicating genomic instability](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.07.503107v1).
