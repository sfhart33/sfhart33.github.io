I am a 4th year PhD student at the University of Washington interested in evolutionary biology. I am a member of the [Metzger Lab](https://www.pnri.org/research/labs/metzger-lab/) at the Pacific Northwest Research Institute, where I study the genomics of a [contagious cancer in soft-shell clams](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4393529/)
