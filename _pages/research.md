**Graduate Research Assisant, 2019-present**

Genomic analysis in a transmissible cancer lineage spreading through the soft-shell clam population. 
- Discovered a novel clock-like mutational signature and used to generate the first bivalve transmissible cancer age estimate (~500 years). 
- Identified widespread copy number gains, genomic rearrangement, and transposable element mobilization indicative of an unstable genome.

**Research Technician, 2015-2018**

Investigated the evolution of cooperation using an engineered system of cross-feeding yeast strains. 
- Established methods for quantifying the metabolic interactions and community behaviors in microbial communities by fitting these behaviors to predictive models. 
- Discovered novel cooperative traits arising during experimental evolution of a cooperative system.

**Undergraduate Research Assistant, 2009-2013**

Researched epidemiology of dairy cow mastitis on organic dairy farms (3.5 years part-time, 1 year full time). 
- Discovered evidence that dairy cattle tissues express different MHC class I alleles across tissues (thesis).
- Quantified the antibacterial effects of organic mastitis treatments on S. aureus in milk. 
- Genotyped S. aureus strains collected from farms across Vermont to infer transmission dynamics.
